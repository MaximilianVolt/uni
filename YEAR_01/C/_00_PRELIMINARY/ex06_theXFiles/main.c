/**
 * @desc
 * Write a C program that reads a text file and counts the number of words, 
 * characters, and lines in the file. The program should also identify the 
 * longest word in the file.
 * 
 * @note
 * The program should prompt the user to enter the filename to be processed.
 * 
 * @note
 * Use standard file I/O functions like `fopen`, `fgetc`, `fgets`, etc.
 * 
 * @note
 * Handle any potential errors (e.g., file not found) gracefully, by displaying 
 * appropriate error messages.
 * 
 * @note
 * Ensure that the program can handle files with varying formats and delimiters 
 * (spaces, tabs, newlines).

/**
 * @desc
 * Write a C program that simulates a basic memory allocator. The program should 
 * allow the user to request memory blocks of varying sizes and then free them 
 * when no longer needed. 
 * 
 * @note
 * Implement a `malloc` and `free` mechanism using linked lists to manage 
 * the memory blocks. 
 * 
 * @note
 * The program should keep track of the allocated and free memory blocks.
 * 
 * @note
 * The user should be able to allocate memory of different sizes, view the 
 * current memory allocation, and free specific blocks.
 * 
 * @note
 * Handle cases where memory cannot be allocated due to insufficient available 
 * memory.

/**
 * @desc
 * Write a C program to manage a simple contact book. The program should allow 
 * the user to add, delete, and search for contacts. Each contact should have 
 * a name, phone number, and email address.
 * 
 * @note
 * Define a custom structure `Contact` to store the details of each contact.
 * 
 * @note
 * Use an array of structures to store multiple contacts, and dynamically 
 * resize this array as contacts are added or removed.
 * 
 * @note
 * Implement a menu-driven interface to perform the operations (add, delete, search).
 * 
 * @note
 * Ensure that the search operation allows for partial matching of the contact name.

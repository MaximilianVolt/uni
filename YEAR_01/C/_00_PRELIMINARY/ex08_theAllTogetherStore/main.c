/**
 * @desc
 * Write a C program that manages an inventory system for a small store. The program 
 * should allow the user to add, remove, update, and search for products. Each product 
 * should have a unique ID, name, quantity, and price.
 * 
 * @note
 * Define a custom structure `Product` to store the details of each product.
 * 
 * @note
 * Use an array of structures to store the products, dynamically resizing the array 
 * as needed.
 * 
 * @note
 * Implement file management to save the inventory data to a file and load it from 
 * a file at the start of the program.
 * 
 * @note
 * Use conditionals to validate input, ensuring, for example, that the quantity 
 * and price are positive values, and that the ID is unique.
 * 
 * @note
 * Implement memory management to handle dynamic allocation of the product list 
 * and ensure that memory leaks are avoided when products are removed from the list.
 * 
 * @note
 * The program should have a menu-driven interface, providing options to the user 
 * for the different operations (add, remove, update, search, save, load, etc.).

/**
 * @desc
 * Write a C program that takes a 4-digit year as input and determines whether 
 * the year is a leap year. The program should also calculate the number of days 
 * in February for that year, considering the different rules that apply for leap years.
 * 
 * @note
 * The rules for leap years are:
 * - The year must be divisible by 4.
 * - If the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless...
 * - The year is also divisible by 400, in which case it is a leap year.
 * 
 * @note
 * The program should validate that the input is a 4-digit year.

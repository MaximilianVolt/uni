### Problem

Imagine a classroom with some students. With **A** we indicate the set of **pens** that the students have, while with **B** we indicate the set of **students** theirselves. With **f : A -> B** we indicate the law which associates a pen with the student who has it with them.

With the following assertions:

a. Every student has **at least** a pen
b. Every student has **only one** pen
c. Every student **that has** a pen, **has got only one**
d. There exists a student **without** pens
e. There exists a student **with more than one** pen

State which defines for the application for **f** the:

1. Injectability
2. Non-injectability
3. Surjectivity
4. Non-surjectivity
5. Bijectivity

### Solution

a -> 3 |
b -> 5 |
c -> 1 |
d -> 4 |
e -> 2 |

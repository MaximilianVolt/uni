## Exercise [1]

### Problem [1]

Imagine a classroom with some students. With **A** we indicate the set of **pens** that the students have, while with **B** we indicate the set of **students** theirselves. With **f : A -> B** we indicate the law which associates a pen with the student who has it with them.

With the following assertions:

- a. Every student has **at least** a pen
- b. Every student has **only one** pen
- c. Every student **that has** a pen, **has got only one**
- d. There exists a student **without** pens
- e. There exists a student **with more than one** pen

State which defines for the application for **f** the:

1. Injectability
2. Non-injectability
3. Surjectivity
4. Non-surjectivity
5. Bijectivity

### Solution [1]

a -> 3 |
b -> 5 |
c -> 1 |
d -> 4 |
e -> 2

## Exercise [2]

### Problem [2]

Determine the law of the inverse functions of the following:

- f1: R -> R, f1(x) = x + 3
- f2: R -> R, f2(x) = 2x + 3
- f3: R{+0} -> {y € R / y >= 1}, f3(x) = x^2 + 1
- f4: {x € R / x >= 1} -> R{+0}, f4(x) = (x - 1)^2

### Solution [2]
